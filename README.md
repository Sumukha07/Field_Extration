## ⚙️ Technologies Employed

### 🧾 PDF Utilities
- **PyPDF2** – For parsing and working with PDF files.
- **pdf2image** – To convert PDF pages into images for OCR input.

### 🔠 OCR Framework
- **Tesseract (via pytesseract)** – Core OCR engine.
- **OpenCV** – Enhances image clarity and text visibility before OCR.

### 🧠 Text Intelligence
- **spaCy** – Powerful NLP tool for smart parsing.
- **scikit-learn** – Validates field predictions via ML techniques.

### 🧪 Development Stack
- **pytest** – Unit testing suite.
- **black** – Enforces code formatting standards.
- **flake8** – Linting for style and error catching.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 📋 Requirements
- Python 3.8+
- Tesseract OCR (installed and in PATH)
- Virtual environment setup recommended

### 🧰 Installation Guide
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-org/pdf-extractor.git
cd pdf-extractor

# Create and activate a virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Copy and configure environment settings
cp .env.example .env
```

### ▶️ Run the Extraction Pipeline
```bash
python src/main.py --input path/to/your/input.pdf --output path/to/save/result.json
```
